/**
 * Abstract repository port for the `users` table.
 *
 * Maps cleanly onto the Clerk-mirrored user record: each app user has a
 * `clerkUserId` that links back to the identity owned by Clerk. All
 * authentication state (password hashes, sessions, MFA factors) lives
 * in Clerk, never here.
 *
 * Implementations:
 *   - `DrizzleUserRepositoryImpl` — postgres-js + Drizzle over the
 *     Railway Postgres pool bound by `registerDbDI`.
 *   - `InMemoryUserRepository` — Map-backed test double.
 *
 * Consumers (routers, webhook handlers, workers) depend ONLY on this
 * abstract class.
